In the design of the home page for an inventory app, the initial step involved consulting the Android Developers guidelines on layout basics, aiming to streamline the design process and minimize revisions. The guidance emphasizes maintaining clear space around edges and interactive elements, placing navigation buttons within easy reach (typically at the bottom of the screen), ensuring consistency in spacing, and aligning text, images, and interactive components for a clean, organized layout. Additionally, the concept of using containment to visually group elements was incorporated to enhance the user interface's clarity and usability.

The proposed home screen layout begins with a reserved space at the top for the system bar, displaying essential information like battery status, cell service, and time. Below this, selectable folders are presented, adhering to the guidelines by ensuring alignment and clarity in the presentation of text and data to prevent user confusion. The design employs visual grouping to organize related items effectively. At the bottom, the navigation is strategically placed for easy access, with a design choice that hints at additional content below, encouraging users to scroll for more options.

This design approach was chosen to enhance user experience by ensuring the interface is intuitive, accessible, and efficient, in line with the Android Developers' best practices. By focusing on usability and adhering to established guidelines, the redesign aims to meet user needs effectively while providing a visually appealing and coherent user interface.
